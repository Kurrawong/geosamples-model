1. Purpose
2. Use within a Supermodel
3. Use of SOSA & schema.org
4. Qualified Relations Pattern & Equivalencies

#### 1. Purpose
The purpose of this model is to group together model elements needed to represent geological samples - rock extracted from boreholes, thin sections, hand-collected sand samples etc. - in a way intuitive to geologists and other users of geological data _and_ also to use established models and modelling practices in the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) community. This should mean the model is easy to use by people familiar with the geosamples domain but also that it work well with large-scale Knowledge Graph, Linked Data and other sophisticated data structures based on graph principles.

#### 2. Use within a Supermodel
This model may be used to represent geological samples in isolation or it may be used with other models, just as any other [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) model may be. However, this model is expected to be used with other models in the geosciences domain with relations between them defined by a _Supermodel_. The Supermodel concept is a multi-model framework designed to support use of multiple _Component Models_, integrative _Background Models_ and so on.

Anyone may use this model in isolation, with other Semantic Web models or within a Supermodel of their own making. The [Geological Survey of Western Australia](https://www.dmp.wa.gov.au/Geological-Survey/Geological-Survey-262.aspx)'s Supermodel that includes this model can be seen online here: <https://kurrawong.github.io/gswa-supermodel/>.


#### 3. Use of SOSA & schema.org
This model declares few new elements - classes, predicates or axioms - and instead re-uses elements from general-purpose and well-known models (ontologies) together with specific values from a few vocabularies.

The main models this model reuses elements from are:

* [Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) Ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/)
* [schema.org Ontology](https://schema.org)

The central class of this model is a SOSA `Sample` and most of the predicates indicated for use with it are from schema.org.

Some other model elements come from [PROV-O](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/), the Provenance Ontology and some spatial elements from [GeoSPARQL](https://docs.ogc.org/is/22-047r1/22-047r1.html).


#### 4. Qualified Relations Pattern & Equivalencies
To provide for many modelling options without declaring large numbers of new predicates for every single property that a geospample may have, this model uses the [Qualified Relation](https://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/qualified-relation.html) pattern. According to this pattern, one data element may link to another, not directly via a specialised predicate but indirectly, via an intermediate element which, in turn, links to "qualifying" information.

For example, instead of creating two predicates to indicate the origin and current location of a sample - where it was obtained from and where it is now stored - perhaps like this:

```
:sample-x
    ex:originLocation [
        # ... location info
    ] ;
    ex:currentLocation [
        # ... location info
    ] ;
.
```

we can do this:

```
:sample-x
    schema:location [
        schema:geo [
            # ... location info
        ] ;
        schema:roleName ex:origin ;
    ] ;
    schema:location [
        schema:geo [
            # ... location info
        ] ;
        schema:roleName ex:current ;
    ] ;
.
```

So instead of inventing two predicates - `ex:originLocation` & `ex:currentLocation` - we just create a vocabulary of _roles_ that locations can have - `ex:origin` & `ex:current`. This may seem equivalent (no better) but it's not (and it is better) as we can qualify things in other ways too such as by time:

```
:sample-x
    schema:location [
        schema:geo [
            # ... location info
        ] ;
        schema:roleName ex:current ;
        schema:startDate "..." ;  # when the sample started being in this place
    ] ;
.
```
